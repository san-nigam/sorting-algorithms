Start with the first elelment in the array.Now keep on increasing size the value of i by 1.
Now the move the ith element to the correct position in the already sorted array.
Complexity worst case:O(n^2) 

Example:
12, 11, 13, 5, 6

Let us loop for i = 1 (second element of the array) to 4 (last element of the array)

first pass : i = 1. Since 11 is smaller than 12, move 12 and insert 11 before 12
11, 12, 13, 5, 6

second pass: i = 2. 13 will remain at its position as all elements in A[0..I-1] are smaller than 13
11, 12, 13, 5, 6

third pass : i = 3. 5 will move to the beginning and all other elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position.
5, 11, 12, 13, 6

fourth pass: i = 4. 6 will move to position after 5, and elements from 11 to 13 will move one position ahead of their current position.
5, 6, 11, 12, 13

total passes : 4
