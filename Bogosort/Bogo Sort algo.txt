Bogo Sort

Bogo Sort is the most inefficient way of sorting an algorithm.
The way Bogo Sort works is like throwing a deck of cards in the air
and picking them back up and checking to see if it's organized .

Array of ints [ 3, 1, 2 ]
Step 1.
Starts at the start of the array and will grab a random index from the array to switch with.

randomIndex = RANDOM NUMBER

Step 2.
Once random index is obtained, it will then switch the current index value with the random index value
Example: randomIndex = 2 , currentIndex = 0

[ 3, 1, 2 ] -----> [ 2, 1, 3 ]

Step 3.
Check if array is sorted.
[ 2, 1, 3 ] <---- Is not sorted so go onto the next index and repeat steps 1 & 2. Stop when sorted

-  You could be done in the next step or the next million step, it's upto your input :')
